The data was obtained from Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center Website. Experiments were conducted  Reliance Electric motor, and acceleration data was measured at locations near to and remote from the motor bearings.  In motor fault diagnosis, particularly when analyzing vibration signals, frequency is a crucial parameter. Since most fault signatures in machinery, such as bearings or gears, manifest at specific rotational frequencies, converting RPM to Hz helps align these fault patterns with the vibration data.Frequency is measured in hz .
